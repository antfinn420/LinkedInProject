What I need to do to broken down to understand by writing it out:


Driver is already open... so it might be hard to connect it to an existing session, rather than just start by scratch might be easier..

 ---- Might start up manually ----------
| 1. Set up the filters programmatically |
| 2. Start the search 				     |
 ---------------------------------------

 Reconnect to driver after you set up filters here
 
 -- Start here first
 
3. Iterate through the results to visit each profile
4. Extract the information from each profile
	a) Get the email from each profile
5. Download the information into a csv file
6. Do an email merge to email each 





Notes:
Being able to package and run the script
saving url / session ID
how does the email finder get email if its not available on the page..?
